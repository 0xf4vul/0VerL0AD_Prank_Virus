# 0VerL0AD_Prank_Virus
A prank virus i created that spams windows, creates random folders, and shuts down the user's computer. This virus does not do any harm to the actual machine. It wont delete the C drive, files, or hold files for a ransom. This is purely intended for pranking my friends, and I thought i'd post it on github so others can pull pranks on their friends as well.
